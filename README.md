# Developer setup, build, and run steps


## Setup

1. Check out this package from version control.
1. Launch Intellij IDEA, choose **Import Project**,  select the root of this package and import it as maven project. 
1. To build from the command line, set `JAVA_HOME` to point to a JDK >=11 before running `mvn`.


## Build

* Source build instructions can be found here : 

https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/security-parent/blob/master/README.md

## Custom CI build for testing

This project is dependent on [security-parent](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/security-parent) repository and [security](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/security) repository.
By default the Github Actions CI workflow checks out the master branch of both the repos.
In order to point to a different repository/fork/branch/tag for testing a pull request, please update `repository` and `ref` inputs of the respective checkout actions in the [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) file. Here is a sample which uses `opendistro-1.3` branch of `security-parent` project during building.

```
    - name: Checkout security-parent
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
      with:
        repository: opendistro-for-elasticsearch/security-parent
        ref: refs/heads/opendistro-1.3
```

## Debugging

Please refer to the well documented instructions provided by popular IDEs like Intellij and Eclipse on how to setup a debugger to debug code/test failures.
